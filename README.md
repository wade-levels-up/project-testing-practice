# project-testing-practice

This was a project I undertook as part of The Odin Project Curriculum

The aim of this project was to get some repetition in around writing tests and using Jest's different matchers for various functions I was given to create.

Overall I really enjoyed this taste of Test-Driven-Development. It's satisfying to fulfill the test conditions though also challenging to put the brakes on and write the tests before proceeding too far ahead with writing the code into the functions. It was a different way of thinking trying to come up with the different cases that my functions would encounter before the function was completely written, but in the end I believe it made my functions more robust and able to handle errors better too. This style of development has been one of the few times I've actually felt it made sense to start writing in error handling (aside from previously doing it when working with API's), and it felt fulfilling to handle errors this way too, so I believe it encourages it.

Possibly the only thing I found challenging here was remembering how to code a Caesar Cypher, and I was a bit intrigued as to how I'd be able to set my package.json up to use "type" module so I could use node index.js to see my code in the console as well as having it play nice with Jest at the same time / run tests.
